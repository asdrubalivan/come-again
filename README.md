Come again?
==========

Come again? is a tool for developing listening skills in a foreign language.

To practice listening effectively, it's important to repeat small sections of a text until you can understand and say them without effort. Since most apps do not offer a convenient way to rewind quickly, I designed Come again? with this in mind.

It works entirely in your browser, so you're not uploading anything when you use it.

You can use **the keys in the home row (A to ;)** to control playback by rewinding/skipping at 1-to-4-second intervals.

You can also use **the numbers 1 to 4** or **the left and right arrow keys** to rewind.

Use **the spacebar** to play or pause the audio.

Use **the up and down arrow keys** to control the volume.

If you want to load a new audio file, just refresh the page.
